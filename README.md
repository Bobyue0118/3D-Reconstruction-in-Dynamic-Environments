# 3D-Reconstruction-in-Dynamic-Environments
> Environment: 

### Description
The majority of SLAM methods focus on static environments, but the deployment in real-world situations requires them to handle _dynamic_ objects.In this project, we are asked to implement an algorithm for a RGB-D sensor that is able to consistently map scenes containing multiple dynamic elements. For this project _a RGB-D sensor_ called Realsense will be provided.
